               This dataset contains information on a list of popular video games that have had sales greater than a 100,000 copies. It gives data on the genre of the video game, its publisher and the sales of the video game in North America, Europe, Japan and the rest of the world.

               <td style="vertical-align: top;">These four bar charts show the average sales of video game genres in North America(NA), Europe(EU), Japan(JP) and the rest of the world(Other). Video game genre can be seen on the y-axis. Each bar chart is sorted from maximum to minimum for each attribute. The bar chart contains an interactive feature where you can compare distict genres in the different regions. </td>

               <td style="vertical-align: top;"><strong>Insight:</strong></td>
               <td style="vertical-align: top;">We can see in the barchart for the average sales in North America, that the genre 'platform' is the most popular one as it has the higest number of sales, while in Europe, the most popular genre is Sports. This is the same for the bar chart that represents the rest of the world as well. While for Japan, Puzzle has the highest average sales, but in the rest of the world, puzzle has the second lowest sales. I didn't anticiapte this, as I would have thought that Sports would have been the most popular genre for all regions. For Japan, Sports has the 7th highest average sales. 'Strategy' has the lowest average sales in North America, Europe and the rest of the world, and has the third lowest sales in Japan. This indicates that the genre strategy is not a popular one due to the lack of sales. Another popular genre with a high number of sales acorss all regions is misc. For North America and Europe it has the third highest average sales and for Japan and the rest of the world it has the fourth highest average sales. Another interesting insight I have found is that genres like shooter, action and racing are lower down on the bar chart for Japan, whereas for the other three bar charts they are shown higher up, indicating that these genres don't get a lot of sales in Japan as compared to the other places. <s></s></td>

               <td style="vertical-align: top;"><strong>Design considerations</strong></td>
               <td style="vertical-align: top;">I have chosen to use bar charts as they are easy to represent quantitative data. By looking at each of the bar charts it is obvious which genre has the highest average sales in each region. This is because the bars are stacked in descending order to make it clear and it also makes the charts look more presentable and appealing to look at. I have chosen to the use the 'small mulitples' approach as I believe that this is an effective way in being able to compare the average sales for each genre in all the different regions. 
               Also, being able to highlight a certain genre in all of the bar charts makes it easy to differenciate what the sales are like for a genre in all of the different regions. It also makes the genre stand out. When one genre is highlighted, the rest of the bars go black. This makes it look attractive to 
               as well. 

               I considered using a grouped bar chart to represent the  data, but I decided not to as there was an excessive amount of data on the graph, which  made it look very chaotic for the viewer. It was also difficult to spot which genre had the highest and lowest average sales for each individual region. ie. trying to find the most popular genre for Europe.   
               I was also going to add another bar chart for the Global_Sales, whihc just gives an overview of the overall sales, but I thought this would make the bar charts look more complex that needs be,   </td>
